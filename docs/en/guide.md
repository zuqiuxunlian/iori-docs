# Guide

## Introduction

The IORI timer is a simple and easy to use that can quickly assist coaches in completing test evaluations of team members and can also be a powerful tool to individual training.

### Why do it

I personally run a non-profit football camp for adults that we train once a week. I also work as a part-time weekend coach for some youth clubs. There is always the problem of how to evaluate the players in the long-term training.

> Evaluation tests, which involve practical exercises designed specifically to obtain the most precise and objective data possible from the basic game components forming part of the teaching content. This type of evaluation is also known as the quantitative method.  
> -- UEFA Fusal Coaching Manual

Evaluation is an essential part of training, so do we have tools to use?

#### Why Not...?

#### Stopwatch

Stopwatches, including mobile phones and sports watches, have timing functions. But there are two disadvantages. You need someone to help you set the watch. Second, there are certain errors in the beginning and end of the hand pinch. We can replace the function of a stopwatch that can be completely replaced, and the time is visible and easy to video record.

#### Infrared/laser timer

To judge the beginning and end by a non-contact way is indeed the most accurate way at present, and does not affect sports performance at all. However, its price is also very expensive, the equipment is not convenient to carry, and the operation threshold of the equipment is relatively high. Our operation is much simpler, even the children can fully master.

### IORI timer advantage

- Only one button, not as many buttons as a stopwatch
- Only one person to complete the test, no assistance, one person to do the work of two people
- Connect mobile phone, remote synchronization control video recording, segment recording, easier to organize
- Create a competitive training culture that improve athletic performance for all

## Classic Test

The IORI timer performs all tests with consistent start and end points. Such as shuttle run, T-test and so on. When we design our training program, we try to have the same start and end point. In addition, the IORI timer can be used to test time challenges, such as the maximum time to juggle continuously and the time to plank.

Of course, we can also just take it as a mobile phone remote controller, with mobile phone and mobile phone tripod, can be very convenient for training video recording.

### T-test

The T-test includes accelerate, decelerate, shuffle, and backward, which are the basic movements required in football. Standard movement, and shorter completion time, the stronger the athletic ability.
